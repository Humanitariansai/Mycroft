## Style Guidelines for All Prompts

- Maintain consistent character appearance based on the silver/white-haired figure in the reference images
- Blend Victorian/Gothic elements (brass instruments, dark wood, leather, clockwork) with high-tech finance elements (trading screens, data visualizations, glass and steel)
- Use dramatic lighting with both warm gas-lamp glow and cool digital screen illumination
- Include subtle Sherlock Holmes references throughout the Victorian elements
- Ensure the character's intense, intelligent expression matches the provided reference images
- Balance the aesthetic: approximately 40% Victorian Gothic, 60% modern high finance
- Use a color palette that combines rich Victorian tones (deep browns, brass) with financial tech blues and greens
