# What is Agentic AI in Finance? The Mycroft Framework

## Introduction
Hello and welcome! Today we're exploring agentic AI and its revolutionary impact on the financial sector through the lens of the Mycroft project. Unlike traditional AI chatbots that simply respond to queries, agentic AI represents the next frontier in artificial intelligence, especially for investment intelligence.

## Definition
Agentic AI uses sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning to autonomously solve complex, multi-step problems. While conventional AI chatbots provide responses based on single interactions, agentic systems can perceive, reason, act, and learn continuously to accomplish financial tasks with minimal human intervention.

## The Four-Step Process
Agentic AI operates through a powerful four-step process:
1. **Perceive**: Financial AI agents gather data from diverse sources including market feeds, financial databases, annual reports, and regulatory filings.
2. **Reason**: Large language models act as orchestrators to understand tasks, generate solutions, and coordinate specialized models for specific financial functions.
3. **Act**: Through integration with external financial tools and platforms, these agents execute tasks based on carefully formulated plans.
4. **Learn**: The system continuously improves through feedback loops, where data generated from interactions enhances future performance.

## The Mycroft Project

### About Mycroft
Named after Sherlock Holmes's enigmatic elder brother, the Mycroft framework is an open-source educational experiment in AI-powered investment intelligence. Led by Professor Nik Bear Brown, PhD, MBA, this project explores how an ecosystem of specialized agents might work together to analyze the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence sector while implementing disciplined investment strategies. The tagline "Using AI to Invest in AI" perfectly encapsulates this innovative approach.

### Starting Small: The Experimental Approach
While hundreds of financial agents could eventually be built, the Mycroft project takes a pragmatic approach by starting with just a few core agents and the Mycroft orchestration layer. This allows the system to evolve based on empirical results from simulated trading environments rather than theoretical assumptions.

### The Four Agent Categories

#### 1. Analytical Agents
These agents gather, process, and interpret vast amounts of information about AI companies and their competitive landscape. For example, a specialized agent might focus solely on parsing annual reports of AI companies to extract key performance metrics and growth indicators.

#### 2. Portfolio Agents
These agents test approaches to transform knowledge into actionable investment strategies with proper diversification and risk management. They run simulated trades to evaluate different portfolio construction methodologies specifically for the AI sector.

#### 3. Advisory Agents
These agents explore human-AI interaction through conversational financial advising, goal-setting, and educational components. They translate complex financial concepts into accessible guidance for users.

#### 4. Intelligence Agents
These agents maintain market awareness by monitoring news, social sentiment, financial reports, and regulatory developments related to AI companies. They provide real-time updates on market conditions and emerging trends.

## The Mycroft Orchestration Layer

### Cross-Agent Validation
The Mycroft orchestration layer tests approaches for identifying when different agents reach contradictory conclusions and resolving these analytical conflicts. This validation process ensures that investment decisions are based on consistent, well-vetted information.

### Dynamic Task Allocation
Mycroft explores approaches to distributing computational resources based on changing market priorities. When market volatility increases, for example, more resources might be allocated to risk management agents.

### Pattern Recognition
The orchestration layer experiments with identifying connections across seemingly unrelated developments in the AI landscape, potentially uncovering investment opportunities that isolated analyses might miss.

## Implementation Philosophy

The Mycroft project emphasizes learning through building rather than claiming to have definitive solutions. This educational experiment invites contributors to discover what approaches actually work in practice by testing them in simulated trading environments.

While the potential for hundreds of specialized agents exists, the project starts with just a few core agents:
- One analytical agent focused on earnings reports
- One portfolio agent testing a specific investment strategy
- One intelligence agent monitoring industry news
- The Mycroft orchestration layer coordinating these specialized agents

This minimal viable approach allows the system to evolve organically, with new agents added only when they demonstrate value in the simulated trading environment.

## Conclusion

The Mycroft project represents a practical implementation of agentic AI in finance, starting with a focused approach and scaling based on empirical results. Rather than building hundreds of agents upfront, it emphasizes starting small, testing thoroughly in simulated environments, and expanding strategically.

By applying agentic AI principles to financial analysis through this experimental framework, the Mycroft project not only explores how AI can enhance investment intelligence but also demonstrates a responsible approach to developing complex AI systems: start small, validate thoroughly, and scale gradually based on proven results.
