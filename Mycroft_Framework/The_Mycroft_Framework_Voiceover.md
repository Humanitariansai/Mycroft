# What is Agentic AI in Finance? The Mycroft Framework

Hey there! I'm excited to chat with you today about agentic AI and how it's changing the game in finance, especially through our Mycroft project. You know those basic AI chatbots that just answer your questions? Well, we're taking things to a whole new level with agentic AI - it's really the next frontier in artificial intelligence, especially when it comes to making smart investment decisions.

So what exactly is agentic AI? Think of it as AI that can actually take the initiative and solve complex problems through sophisticated reasoning and step-by-step planning. Unlike those regular chatbots that just respond when you ask something, our agentic systems can perceive what's happening, reason through it, take action, and keep learning - all to handle your financial tasks with barely any hand-holding from you.

Agentic AI works through four key steps:

First, it **perceives** - gathering data from all over the place like market feeds, financial databases, annual reports, and regulatory filings. It's like having a team of research assistants working 24/7.

Then it **reasons** - using large language models as the brains of the operation to understand tasks, come up with solutions, and coordinate specialized models for different financial tasks.

Next, it **acts** - connecting with external financial tools and platforms to actually execute tasks based on the plans it's made. No more just giving advice - it can take action!

Finally, it **learns** - getting better every day through feedback loops. The data from each interaction feeds back into the system, making it smarter over time.

We named our project after Mycroft Holmes - you know, Sherlock's super-smart older brother? It's an open-source educational experiment in AI-powered investment intelligence. I'm Professor Nik Bear Brown, and I lead this project where we're exploring how different specialized agents can work together to analyze the AI sector while implementing disciplined investment strategies. We like to say we're "Using AI to Invest in AI" - pretty neat, right?

Now, we could build hundreds of financial agents, but that would be overwhelming. Instead, we're taking a more practical approach by starting with just a few core agents plus our Mycroft orchestration layer. This way, we can see what actually works in our simulated trading environments rather than making a bunch of theoretical assumptions that might not pan out in the real world.

Let me tell you about our four types of agents:

Our **Analytical Agents** are like financial detectives. They gather, process, and interpret tons of information about AI companies. For instance, we have one agent that just focuses on reading annual reports to extract key performance metrics and growth indicators. It's amazing what these agents can uncover when they really dig into the data!

Then we have our **Portfolio Agents**. These are the strategists that take all that knowledge and turn it into actionable investment strategies. They're constantly running simulated trades to see what works best for the AI sector. Think of them as the cautious money managers making sure we're properly diversified and managing risk.

Our **Advisory Agents** are the communicators. They're exploring how AI and humans can best interact through conversational financial advising. They're great at explaining complex financial concepts in ways that make sense to regular people. It's like having a financial advisor that actually speaks plain English!

And finally, our **Intelligence Agents** keep their finger on the pulse of the market. They're constantly monitoring news, social sentiment, financial reports, and regulatory developments. If something happens that might affect AI companies, these agents know about it almost instantly.

But here's where it gets really interesting - all these agents need someone to coordinate them, right? That's where our Mycroft orchestration layer comes in.

One of the coolest things it does is **Cross-Agent Validation**. Sometimes our agents might reach different conclusions, and Mycroft helps sort out these conflicts. It's like having a wise mediator that ensures our investment decisions are based on consistent, well-vetted information.

It also handles **Dynamic Task Allocation**. When market priorities change, Mycroft redistributes resources accordingly. For example, when markets get volatile, it might allocate more resources to our risk management agents. It's like a smart project manager adapting to changing conditions.

And it's amazing at **Pattern Recognition** - finding connections across seemingly unrelated developments in the AI landscape. Sometimes the most profitable insights come from connecting dots that nobody else is connecting.

We're big believers in learning by doing rather than claiming to have all the answers. Our educational experiment invites contributors to discover what actually works in practice by testing approaches in simulated trading environments.

While we could build hundreds of specialized agents, we're starting with just a few core ones:
- One analytical agent focused on earnings reports
- One portfolio agent testing a specific investment strategy
- One intelligence agent keeping tabs on industry news
- And of course, the Mycroft orchestration layer that coordinates everything

This minimal approach lets us evolve organically. We only add new agents when they prove their worth in our simulated environment. It's like starting a band - you don't need twenty musicians, you need the right few who play well together.

So that's the Mycroft project in a nutshell - a practical way to implement agentic AI in finance. We're starting focused and scaling based on what actually works, not what we think might work. Instead of building a massive system upfront, we're starting small, testing thoroughly, and growing strategically.

By applying these agentic AI principles to financial analysis, we're not just exploring how AI can boost investment intelligence. We're also showing a responsible way to develop complex AI systems: start small, validate thoroughly, and scale gradually based on proven results.

I hope this gives you a good picture of what we're doing with Mycroft and how agentic AI is transforming finance. It's an exciting journey, and we're just getting started!
