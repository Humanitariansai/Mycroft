# What is Agentic AI in Finance? The Mycroft Framework

Hey there! I'm excited to chat about agentic AI and how it's changing finance through our Mycroft project. Unlike basic AI chatbots that just answer questions, agentic AI takes things to a whole new level - especially for making smart investment decisions.

So what is agentic AI? Think of it as AI that takes initiative to solve complex problems through sophisticated reasoning. Unlike regular chatbots, our agentic systems perceive what's happening, reason through it, take action, and keep learning - handling financial tasks with minimal human intervention.

Agentic AI works through four key steps:

It **perceives** - gathering data from market feeds, financial databases, and regulatory filings like a team of research assistants working 24/7.

It **reasons** - using large language models as the brains to understand tasks and coordinate specialized models for different financial functions.

It **acts** - connecting with financial tools to execute tasks based on its plans. No more just giving advice - it takes action!

And it **learns** - improving every day through feedback loops that make it smarter over time.

We named our project after Mycroft Holmes - Sherlock's brilliant older brother. I'm Professor Nik Bear Brown, leading this open-source educational experiment in AI-powered investment intelligence. We're exploring how specialized agents can analyze the AI sector while implementing disciplined investment strategies - "Using AI to Invest in AI."

Instead of building hundreds of financial agents, we're starting with just a few core agents plus our orchestration layer. This lets us see what actually works in simulated trading environments rather than making theoretical assumptions.

Our **Analytical Agents** are financial detectives gathering information about AI companies. Our **Portfolio Agents** transform knowledge into actionable investment strategies through simulated trades. Our **Advisory Agents** handle human-AI interaction through conversational financial advising. And our **Intelligence Agents** monitor news, social sentiment, and regulatory developments in real-time.

The magic happens in our Mycroft orchestration layer. It handles **Cross-Agent Validation** to sort out conflicting conclusions, **Dynamic Task Allocation** to redistribute resources when market priorities change, and **Pattern Recognition** to find connections across seemingly unrelated developments.

We're starting with just four components: one analytical agent for earnings reports, one portfolio agent testing an investment strategy, one intelligence agent monitoring industry news, and the Mycroft orchestration layer. We only add new agents when they prove their worth in our simulated environment - like a band that needs the right few musicians, not twenty.

The Mycroft project is a practical implementation of agentic AI in finance. We're starting focused and scaling based on what works, not what we think might work. By applying these principles, we're showing a responsible approach to complex AI systems: start small, validate thoroughly, and scale based on proven results.
