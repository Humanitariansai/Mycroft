# Mycroft Orchestrator

A multi-agent orchestration system that intelligently routes user queries to specialized financial and patent intelligence workflows using natural language processing.

## Overview

The Orchestrator serves as the central dispatcher for the Mycroft intelligence platform. It uses a local LLM (Llama 3) to analyze natural language queries and automatically route them to the appropriate specialized agent.

## Architecture

```
User Query → Chat Interface → LLM Analyzer → Validator → HTTP Router → Specialized Agent
```

## Available Tools

### 1. Patent Monitor
Monitors and analyzes recent patent filings from the USPTO.

**Parameters:**
- `days_back` (integer, required) - Number of days to look back
- `email` (string, optional) - Email for report delivery

**Example:** *"Show me patents from the last 7 days"*

---

### 2. Financial Metrics
Analyzes SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q) for financial insights.

**Parameters:**
- `ticker` (string, required) - Stock ticker (e.g., "AAPL", "TSLA")
- `narrative` (boolean, required) - Include narrative analysis

**Example:** *"Get financial metrics for AAPL"*

---

### 3. News Sentiment
Aggregates news and performs sentiment analysis using FinBERT.

**Parameters:**
- `company` (string, required) - Company name
- `email` (string, optional) - Email for report delivery

**Example:** *"Analyze news sentiment for Microsoft"*

---

### 4. Forecasting
Generates price forecasts using market data and sentiment.

**Parameters:**
- `ticker` (string, required) - Stock ticker
- `email` (string, required) - Email for results
- `horizon` (integer, optional, default: 30) - Forecast days

**Example:** *"Forecast NVDA for the next 45 days"*

## How It Works

1. **Query Analysis** - LLM determines the appropriate tool and parameters
2. **Validation** - Parameters are type-checked against schema
3. **Routing** - HTTP request dispatched to the agent webhook
4. **Response** - Agent processes request and returns results

## Example Queries

```
"Monitor patents from the last 30 days"
"Get detailed analysis for TSLA"
"What's the sentiment on Amazon lately?"
"Forecast NVDA for 60 days"
```

## Key Features

- Natural language interface
- Intelligent tool routing
- Type-safe validation

- User session management and context preservation
- Tool result caching and optimization
- Enhanced natural language understanding
- Query analytics and performance monitoring
- Additional tool integrations (market data, regulatory filings)
- Intent confidence scoring for ambiguous queries
