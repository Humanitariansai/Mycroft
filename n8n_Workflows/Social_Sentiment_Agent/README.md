## Overview

The Mycroft Social Sentiment Agent is an open-source educational experiment in AI-powered investment intelligence. Named after Sherlock Holmes's analytical elder brother, this agent processes social media discussions about artificial intelligence to generate actionable investment signals.

This agent focuses on technical communities rather than general retail sentiment, providing professional-grade intelligence from developers, researchers, and ML practitioners who are actually building AI technology.

- **Developer Community Sentiment Tracking** - Monitors engagement, problem-solving, and innovation indicators
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio Optimization** - Multi-dimensional quality filtering for actionable intelligence

### Data Sources (3-Source Architecture)
- **StackOverflow** - AI technical discussions and developer Q&A
- **GitHub** - AI repository activity and trending projects
- **Reddit r/MachineLearning** - ML community research discussions

### AI Technology Stack
- **Groq API** with Llama 3.1-8B model for lightning-fast sentiment analysis
- **Custom prompt engineering** for investment-focused classification
- **Real-time processing** of social media content
- **Automated quality scoring** and signal filtering
- **Google Cloud integration** for secure data storage
