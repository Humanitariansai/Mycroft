## AI News Sentiment Workflow

Daily workflow that monitors AI news and alerts on negative sentiment. Uses NewsAPI to fetch headlines, applies keyword-based sentiment analysis with embedded Python, stores results in Airtable, and sends email notifications for negative articles only. Simple yet effective implementation showing n8n's ability to combine visual workflow design with custom code.

> ⚠️ Note: This version is a starting point and **not yet production-grade**. We're currently working on a more robust implementation using advanced sentiment models and real-time triggers.
