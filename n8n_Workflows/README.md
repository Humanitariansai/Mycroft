## AI News Sentiment Workflow
Daily workflow that monitors AI news and alerts on negative sentiment. Uses NewsAPI to fetch headlines, applies keyword-based sentiment analysis with embedded Python, stores results in Airtable, and sends email notifications for negative articles only. Simple yet effective implementation showing n8n's ability to combine visual workflow design with custom code.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This version is a starting point.

## Financial Metrics Analysis Workflow
Tool that analyzes SEC financial filings for publicly traded companies.

## Patent Intelligence System Workflow
Automated patent monitoring and AI classification system that tracks recent USPTO patent filings. Extracts patent metadata from PatentsView API using cursor-based pagination, processes records to identify AI-related innovations through keyword matching and CPC code analysis, normalizes company names, and generates intelligence reports with confidence scoring. Delivers CSV data and metrics JSON via email for competitive intelligence and technology scouting.

## Forecasting Agent Workflow

An n8n workflow that generates stock price forecasts by combining market data (Alpha Vantage) with FinBERT-based sentiment analysis.  
The agent computes optimistic, realistic, and pessimistic scenarios, applies volatility-based risk scoring, and stores results in PostgreSQL for downstream dashboards.
